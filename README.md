# Heriot-Watt F1TENTH Student Autonomous Racing Team

## About
This repository contains autonomous racing algorithms developed by students for the **F1TENTH/RoboRacer competition**. We are creating our own algorithms and techniques for better autonomous driving using NVIDIA Jetson hardware.

## Mission
**Don't crash, minimize lap time, and overtake opponents** - We are developing innovative perception, planning, and control algorithms for 1:10 scale autonomous race cars in high-speed racing scenarios.

## Development Environment
- **Framework**: ROS 2 for modular software architecture
- **Simulation**: F1TENTH Gym, Gazebo for algorithm development and testing
- **Programming**: Python/C++ for algorithm implementation

## Research Goals
1. Develop novel autonomous racing algorithms for competitive performance
2. Create robust perception systems for various racing conditions  
3. Design efficient planning algorithms for multi-agent racing scenarios
4. Contribute to the open-source F1TENTH community

## License
MIT License - All algorithms and techniques developed are open-source to benefit the autonomous driving research community
